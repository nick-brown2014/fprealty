            <p className='text-white lg:pr-6'>
              I moved to Fort Collins, CO in 1992 from Vermont and went to Colorado State University where I got a bachelor&#39;s degree in Chemical Engineering in 1997.
              Right out of school, I went to work for New Belgium Brewing Company as a mechanic and eventually worked my way up to be the brewery&#39;s environmental engineer.  After 8 years at the Brewery, I went on to consulting engineering, designing, and building industrial wastewater treatment facilities for companies like Alcoa, Avago, Oskar Blues, and Fort Collins Brewery.
              While working as an engineer I got my real estate license, so I could buy and sell investment properties on the side.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              After two decades of working in engineering, I grew tired of working for other people and having little to no control over the direction my career was going in. I wanted more connection and interaction with people.  So, in 2013 I decided it was time for a change and took a leap of faith, quit my engineering job and started selling real estate full time.
              The first year was rough as most of my time went into cultivating skills, but I found a niche market in Red Feather Lakes and Livermore.
              I learned everything I could about the area and that combined with my engineering knowledge gave me a solid basis to work from. I&#39;ve always loved to be outside, so servicing rural and mountain properties was a natural fit for me.
              As time went on I also started selling more homes in and around Fort Collins. The “engineering approach” worked well and I started selling homes by creating a streamlined, clear step-by-step process.  Using the systems I developed made the marketing and selling process simple and very profitable for my clients. 
              After several years I decided it was time to open my brokerage, so in 2019 I opened Porter Real Estate!! Then recently, in 2023, I hired my daughter, Isabella.  Now Porter Real Estate is truly a small family-run business!
              I&#39;ve lived in Fort Collins for more than 30 years and watched it grow and evolve.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Like many people here, I love to ski and ride my bike. Fort Collins is within a day's drive of Summit County and also close to Cameron Pass, which is an amazing playground for skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer.
              Fort Collins also has some of the best mountain biking on the front range and there are an infinite number of gravel and road rides right out your back door. My favorite mountain bike ride is the Blue Sky trail down to the Devil&#39;s Backbone in Loveland.  It's a great rolling single track that you can rip along with some technical sections and a little climbing too.
              On days when I&#39;m not able to ski or mountain bike, I volunteer as a skating official for the Fort Collins Women's Roller Derby league and do CrossFit at Crossfit DNR Voted the best Crossfit gym in FoCO several years running!
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              I love living in Fort Collins, I raised my two daughters here and enjoyed all of the amazing recreation right outside my back door.  Looking back, I&#39;m so grateful I took the “leap of faith”.  Since then,  I&#39;ve helped hundreds of people just like you buy and sell homes in Northern Colorado. I especially love introducing new people to Colorado and the Fort Collins area.
              I&#39;m very grateful for all of my wonderful clients, every year Porter Real Estate has grown and as of 2024 our gross annual sales exceeded $10M.
